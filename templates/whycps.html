    <h1 class="center">1. Save Money</h1>
    <p class="center">The most obvious reason to carpool is that you end up spending much less than you would by almost any other way to cover distance on your own. So you aren’t endlessly spending too much on a regular travel routine or shortening your travel budgets and plans. </p>


   <h1 class="center">2. Greener</h1>
    <p class="center">While we are listing down the obvious, the second in line, must be the benefits to the environment that trod along the concept. Lesser fuel- Lesser Pollution-Lesser vehicles on  the road. You know how it’s spelt.</p>

 <h1 class="center">3. Lesser traffic jams </h1>
    <p class="center">Unless you have acquired a thing for taking selfies while stuck in jams, carpooling is perhaps one of the best ideas to reduce the vehicles on the road and ensure scarcer traffic.</p>
    
     <h1 class="center">4. Sharing is good</h1>
    <p class="center">A strand of the Sharing economy, a ride you share is not just good for you but a new opportunity for communities and organizations to use human and physical resources more efficiently as well as a shift in the conventional way people use and own resources.</p>
